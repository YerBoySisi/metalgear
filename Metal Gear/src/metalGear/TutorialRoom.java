			 * An arrow means they're alive, a G means they're dead
Guards move every other turn, so take advantage of that
Their field of view is right in front of them, 2 spaces forward, and to the left and right of 2 spaces forward
You kill Guards by walking into them out of their FOV
If you move in their FOV, it's game over
You can tell which way a guard is looking by the direction of the arrow
Guards can't see through walls, so take advantage
When a Guard sees a camera or a dead body, they'll get rid of it and be alerted
Careful! When a guard is alerted, their FOV increases, and they see both in front of and behind them
